Originally a Caltech student club started by [Eduardo da Veiga Beltrame](https://munfred.com) in 2018, Sovereignty Club is now a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization open to all. Our mission is to promote understanding of the world and its people. We hold weekly meetings where we invite guest speakers to talk about geopolitics, history, governance, and many other topics. We also encourage extensive discussion and debate, both with the speakers and among members, so that different perspectives can be heard and considered. Previous guest speakers have included foreign policy expert Joshua Keating, Caltech professor Tracy Dennison, and Charter Cities Institute founder Mark Lutter.


[Join our mailing list!](https://forms.gle/ZnhRc3ZvjX7fhVwU8) It's fun.


We meet every Wednesday at 6PM PST (and occasionally also at other times).
